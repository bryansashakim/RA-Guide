# RA-Guide
Brief guide for people who might want to be RAs or are incoming RAs

Very unfinished. There are some helpful files within the src/ directory though.

Hello!

This is a guide for new research assistants (RAs) in Economics, based on things I've learned in my time as an RA. Specifically, this guide focuses on using automation effectively to become more productive, and should be useful beyond Economics. If interested in a careeer in economics research, data science/analysis/analytics, this may be helpful for you. This aims to be comprehensive, but does not claim to be authoritative. These techniques have worked well for me; some may work well for you too.
