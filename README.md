# RA-Guide
Brief guide for people who might want to be RAs or are incoming RAs
Very unfinished. There are some helpful files within the src/ directory though.

Hello!

This is a guide for new research assistants (RAs) in Economics, based on things I've learned in my time as an RA. Specifically, this guide focuses on using automation effectively to become more productive, and should be useful beyond Economics. If interested in a careeer in economics research, data science/analysis/analytics, this may be helpful for you. I've worked as an RA for an MIT professor doing algorithmic work, an RA at the Dallas Fed doing Stata and Python programming, an economic consulting firm doing Stata stuff, and as an RA at the NBER doing all kinds of stuff. I hope to document things I learned, things I found useful from those experiences and hopefully you can learn vicariously from me. This aims to be comprehensive, but does not claim to be authoritative. These techniques have worked well for me; some may work well for you too.
